### Exercises for practicals

This branch contains exercises for the practicals sessions of "High Performance Computing and Aspects of Computing in Lattice Gauge Theories", of the EuroPLEx School 2020. 

Exercises include:

1. [AoS-to-SoA](https://github.com/g-koutsou/EuroPLEx2020/tree/exercises/AoS-to-SoA)
2. [Lapl](https://github.com/g-koutsou/EuroPLEx2020/tree/exercises/Lapl)

### Preparation

Following the practicals requires a C compiler with OpenMP support and a Python interpreter with modules [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org) and [`numpy`](https://numpy.org) available. Instructions on how to install and test these can be found under the [`prep`](https://github.com/g-koutsou/EuroPLEx2020/tree/prep) branch, the default branch of this repository.
